The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.

Placing this material on internal or public servers is
also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.

Enclosed are two copies of the Moby Lexicons.

One copy is fully expanded text in the directory called TEXT.

The other copy is compressed disk images (.dsk) in IMAGE that
were created using Norton Navigator for Windows 95 and can be
mass copied onto high density 3.5" diskettes using that utility.

Have fun. Name one of your AIs after me.
